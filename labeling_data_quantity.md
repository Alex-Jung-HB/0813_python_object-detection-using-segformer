## Conclusion

**Start small, iterate quickly:**
1. Begin with 500-1,000 carefully selected images
2. Train a baseline model
3. Identify failure modes
4. Collect targeted additional data
5. Repeat until performance requirements are met

**Remember**: Quality beats quantity every time. 1,000 perfectly labeled images often outperform 5,000 poorly labeled ones.

The exact number depends on your specific use case, but these guidelines will help you plan your data collection strategy effectively.
